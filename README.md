# Machine Learning with Python Project
## Predicting Car Prices using KNN Regressor

### Objective:
  The aim of this project is to predict car prices using Python scikit-learn library and KNN Regressor algorithm. This project is an introductory KNN project.


### Dataset:
  The dataset contains three types of entities: (a) the specification of an auto in terms of various characteristics, (b) its assigned insurance risk rating, (c) its normalized losses in use as compared to other cars. The second rating corresponds to the degree to which the auto is more risky than its price indicates. [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/automobile) dataset was used for the analyses.

### Analyses
  The dataset is explored and cleaned. Missing values were handled. For each numeric columns, a univariate regression model was created. Lastly, a multivariate model included best features was created.
